module Graphql.SelectionSet exposing
    ( with, hardcoded, empty, map, succeed, fieldSelection
    , SelectionSet(..), FragmentSelectionSet(..)
    )

{-| The auto-generated code from the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` CLI will provide `selection`
functions for Objects, Interfaces, and Unions in your GraphQL schema.
These functions build up a `Graphql.SelectionSet` which describes a set
of fields to retrieve. The `SelectionSet` is built up in a pipeline similar to how
[`Json.Decode.Pipeline`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline/latest)
builds up decoders.

For example, if you had a top-level query `human(id: ID!)` which returns an object
of type `Human`, you could build the following GraphQL query document:

    query {
      human(id: 1001) {
        name
        id
      }
    }

In this example, the `SelectionSet` on `human` is:

    {
      name
      id
    }

You could build up the above `SelectionSet` with the following `dillonkearns/elm-graphql` code:

    import Api.Object
    import Api.Object.Human as Human
    import Graphql.SelectionSet exposing (SelectionSet, with)

    type alias Human =
        { name : String
        , id : String
        }

    hero : SelectionSet Hero Api.Interface.Human
    hero =
        Human.selection Human
            |> with Human.name
            |> with Human.id

Note that all of the modules under `Api.` in this case are generated by running
the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` command line tool.

The query itself is also a `SelectionSet` so it is built up similarly.
See [this live code demo](https://rebrand.ly/graphqelm) for an example.

## Types

These types are built for you by the code generated by the `@dillonkearns/elm-graphql` command line tool.

{-| Include a hardcoded value.

        import Api.Object

-}
hardcoded : a -> SelectionSet (a -> b) typeLock -> SelectionSet b typeLock

        (Decode.map2 (|>)
            (Decode.succeed constant)
            objectDecoder
        )


{-| Instead of hardcoding a field like `hardcoded`, `SelectionSet.succeed` hardcodes
an entire `SelectionSet`. This can be useful if you want hardcoded data based on
only the type when using a polymorphic type (Interface or Union).

    type alias Character =
        { details : Maybe HumanOrDroid
        , name : String
        }

    type HumanOrDroid
        = Human
        | Droid

    hero : SelectionSet Character Swapi.Interface.Character
    hero =
        Character.selection Character
            [ Character.onDroid (SelectionSet.succeed Droid)
            , Character.onHuman (SelectionSet.succeed Human)
            ]
            |> with Character.name

-}
succeed : a -> SelectionSet a typeLock
succeed constant =
    SelectionSet [ RawField.Leaf "__typename" [] ] (Decode.succeed constant)
